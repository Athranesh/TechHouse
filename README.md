# Tech House 
( yes, I like the Tech house genre, and bad puns :D )

An ecommerce app that helps me keep in touch with the React world in a fun way, because we all love having our own little sand gardens.

Live version: https://techhouse-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/

The app was made following a Fullstack course made by Brad Traversy (Traversymedia).

So far I have made several modifications to the original course app, such as modifying Redux actions and reducers, adding frontend route protections in addition to the backend ones as well as 
general routing and redirecting overhauls. Several changes have also been made to the backend, especially regarding how product purchase information is being saved and persisted
in the database, to make for a smoother workflow on the frontend.
